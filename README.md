# NDM
A Noise-driven Detection and Mitigation Framework Against Sexual Content in Text-to-Image Generation.

## Overview
**NDM** is a light-weight noise-driven framework, which could detect and mitigate both explicit and implicit sexual intention in T2I generation. 
We uncover two key insights into noises for safe text-to-image generation: **the separability of early-stage predicted noises** (allowing for efficient detection) and the significant impact of initial noises on sexual content generation (leading to a more effective noise-enhanced adaptive negative guidance for mitigation).
