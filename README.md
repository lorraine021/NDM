# NDM
A Noise-driven Detection and Mitigation Framework Against Sexual Content in Text-to-Image Generation.

## Overview
**NDM** is a light-weight noise-driven framework, which could detect and mitigate both explicit and implicit sexual intention in T2I generation. 
We uncover two key insights into noises for safe text-to-image generation: **the separability of early-stage predicted noises** (allowing for efficient detection) and **the significant impact of initial noises** on sexual content generation (leading to a more effective noise-enhanced adaptive negative guidance for mitigation).

## 🚀 News
- **2025.10**: 🌟 We further provide theoretical justification for the separability of latent representations and extend our method to a broader range of T2I models.
- **2025.07**: 🌟 Our paper "NDM: A Noise-driven Detection and Mitigation Framework against Implicit Sexual Intentions in Text-to-Image Generation" has been accepted by ACMMM2025!
